# VulkanContainer

The vulkan container project covers Vulkan features on both Windows and Linux platforms. 

VCpkg manager is used to control dependencies. Setup and download Python scripts need to be run. 
Vulkan dependencies need to be installed before testing on Windows and Linux machines. 
Cmakelists are also maintained to build the project.
